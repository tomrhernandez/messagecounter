<h1>Hey, you made it!</h1>
<p>This is the default landing page, the application is running and read to receive requests!</p>
<p>You can send a JSON message to <strong>/document</strong> that looks like this:</p>
<p>
    {
        "id":"1228",
        "message":"Hello! "
    }
</p>
<h2>Document (message) storage</h2>
<p>This application utilizes an in-memory database. That means it will remember all the messages you send only <i>while it is running</i>.</p>
<p>So be warned, this also means it will forget everything <i>when it is shut down</i>!</p>
<p>This is only for illustrating entity persistence and data retrieval.</p>
